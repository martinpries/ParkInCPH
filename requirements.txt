# Project Requirements: ParkInCPH

## 1. Overview
ParkInCPH is a web application designed to help users find and compare parking options in Copenhagen based on location, time, and cost.

## 2. Core Functionality
- **Address Input:** Users can input a Copenhagen address.
- **Proximity Search:** The application identifies parking options within a 1-kilometer radius of the provided address.
- **Time-Based Calculation:** Users input arrival and departure dates and times.
- **Cost Calculation:** The application calculates the parking cost for each option based on its pricing schema and the specified time frame.
- **Parking Spot Information:** Display parking spot details including:
    - Name
    - Pricing schema
    - GPS coordinates (potentially multiple coordinates for area-based parking)
- **Map Integration:** (Future Implementation) Display parking options on a map.

## 3. Technical Requirements
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Repository:** GitHub
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (with GitHub Actions for automated deployment)
- **Frontend:**
    - Slick, modern, and minimalistic user interface.
- **Mapping Library:** Leaflet.js

## 4. Data Requirements
- **Parking Spot Data:**
    - Name (string)
    - Pricing schema (data structure to define pricing, e.g., hourly rates, daily rates, zone-based rates)
    - GPS Coordinates (array of lat/lon pairs OR a representation of a parking area)

## 5. Deployment Workflow
- GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and deploy the Next.js application to GitHub Pages on each push to the main branch.

## 6. Future Considerations
- Map integration to visually display parking options.
